2: Disclaimer
=============

  This list is not what I call good reading material.  It is maintained so
  you can search The Internet Movie Database for titles that may fit certain
  criteria.  If a keyword is inappropriately listed here, please spare a 
  few minutes to update it.


3: Facts & Figures
==================

There are currently 513575 titles with keywords.
There are currently 4964068 keywords entries.


4: The Keywords
===============

   This list of keywords exists for the sole purpose of increasing
   the searchability of The Internet Movie Database.

   Keywords should primarily pertain to any part of the subject or
   subjects depicted in the movie.

   Very few external keywords such as "experimental", "sequel"
   "student-film" are permissible.  External keywords do not
   directly appear in, or describe the movie, but instead indirectly
   cover the film's contextual ideals and/or processes.

   The Keywords are inherently large in number and scope.

   No white space is allowed.  ie "based on play" is wrong;
   its "based-on-play"

   How To Add Keywords 
   -------------------

   Send email to   adds@imdb.com   with the subject "ADD".  Above
   the data you write the word "KEYWORD" on a line by itself.
   "KEYWORDS" also works.

   Under that you write the titles and keywords like this:

      <title>|<keyword>

   When there are more keywords for a movie, simply add them on
   multiple lines under each other, like this:

      <title1>|<keyword1>
      <title1>|<keyword1>
      <title1>|<keyword3>

   When you do it that way, the most important keywords should come on top,
   and the least important keywords on the bottom.  The order should
   represent how valid the keywords are.

   Example:

      To: adds@imdb.com
      Subject: ADD

      KEYWORDS
      Point Break|heist
      Point Break|surfing
      Speed (1994)|explosion-if-vehicle-stops
      Speed (1994)|handcuffs
      END

   Note that alk keywords should be in lower-case.

   Some examples on keywords you shouldn't add:

        Incorrect keywords                 Correct keywords
        ----------------                   --------------
        Martial Arts                       martial-arts

        Student Film                       student-film

        COMEDY                             comedy

   Do not put the keyword comedy for an actual Comedy!

   This is to enhance the searchability of the Database.

   The separate Genre list is for proper Genres.

   Keywords should match genre descriptions (eg sci-fi, horro) only if
   the title contain aspects of the specified genre.

   eg.  Ghostbusters is in the Comedy genre.  

    1) The keyword "Comedy" should not be added.
    2) The keyword "horror" maybe be added to Ghostbusters.  


   GUIDE TO CORRECT KEYWORDS
   -------------------------

   Sometimes keywords that don't fit a movie are added, and they should be
   removed as soon as possible.

   To remove a keyword from a movie, just put a "!" in front of the line,
   like this (to remove the keyword "Sci-Fi" from "Star Wars":

      KEYWORDS
      !Star Wars (1977)|sci-fi
      END

   (Stars War is of the Sci-Fi genre.  And thus the sci-fi keyword
   is inappropriate.)
